The Asset Management Digital Challenge: 
Few improvements needed in the code before the code goes into production are:

Making the code more transactional using annotation : @Transactional and exposing more Transaction related services.

Hold the amount in escrow account and transaction reversal if the amount debited cannot be credited to beneficiary.

Concrete  exception handling.

Implement Record keeping service and validating transaction before completing the transaction.
